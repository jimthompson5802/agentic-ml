## User Story

As a data scientist, I want to track and restore datasets with native DVC so that experiment inputs can be identified and reproduced.

## Description

Delivery: M1 and M2. No implementation acceptance is claimed.

Original criterion IDs and issue discussion are preserved. The approved disposition changes this issue's remaining scope; this is not completed implementation.

Criterion assignment: US-13-AC-01: M1; US-13-AC-02: M1; US-13-AC-03: M2; US-13-AC-04: M2.

Scope source: MVP-SC-01/MVP-SC-02, Gate 1 approved on 2026-11-06 by
“i approve gate 1 and authorize phase 2”. This scope revision does not claim
new implementation acceptance. Preserve the scope-decision comment and original
issue history.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **US-13-AC-01:** DVC versions source snapshots, split manifests, and derived datasets as those artifacts are introduced.
- [ ] **US-13-AC-02:** Git tracks DVC metadata and relevant manifests while dataset content resides in the configured cache/storage and is excluded from Git.
- [ ] **US-13-AC-03:** A dataset can be restored from configured storage using its recorded metadata, and restored content hashes are verified.
- [ ] **US-13-AC-04:** Missing or mismatched content prevents the dataset from being treated as successfully restored.

## Scope / Non-Goals

**In Scope:**

- The milestone slices above, through installed public interfaces in a separate experiment project.
- Trusted local code; project-owned configuration, models and preprocessing; MLflow records and native DVC stages.
- Component criteria own technical behavior; integration criteria own cross-component and assistant usability evidence.

**Out of Scope:**

- Managed agents and autonomous loops; mandatory experiment workflow approvals.
- OS-enforced filesystem/network/credential/holdout isolation and arbitrary-Python bypass prevention.
- Hard runtime/resource/cost quotas, durable workflow recovery and comprehensive dirty-source replay.
- Additional frameworks and connectors beyond the approved MVP. Displaced clauses remain in the migration record.

## Implementation Phase

**Phase:** Not specified. Define story/milestone implementation phases and granular tasks in a separate owning plan.

**Deliverables:** The assigned milestone outcomes and criterion-mapped evidence above.

**Developer Validation:** Confirm public test boundaries before executable tests. Stop at every implementation phase gate, including the final gate, for explicit developer approval.

**Exit Criteria:** Verify the assigned criteria; phase approval and whole-story/milestone acceptance remain distinct. Written-plan approval does not approve implementation gates.

## Validation Approach

### Automated Validation

- Git-tracked DVC metadata, excluded content, restore identity checks and missing/corrupt data failures.
- Use independently defined outcomes through installed public interfaces and separate experiment-project fixtures; follow small vertical red–green TDD slices.
- Follow the repository verification policy: current milestone at executable gates; M1–6 selection at story acceptance; preserve failures/skips and explicit authorization requirements for broader/artifact checks.

### Developer Validation

- Review criterion-mapped evidence, failures, artifact/run/data references and platform/tool identities.
- Preserve development approval gates and separate milestone verification obligations; do not infer runtime behavior from documentation.
