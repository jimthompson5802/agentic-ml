## User Story

As a data scientist, I want agents to propose delegated feature, metric, and algorithm decisions for approval so that I retain control over the experiment design.

## Description

Uncommitted roadmap; historical milestones retained only as migration context.

Original criterion IDs and issue discussion are preserved. The approved disposition changes this issue's remaining scope; this is not completed implementation.

Criterion assignment: US-04-AC-01: deferred; US-04-AC-02: deferred; US-04-AC-03: deferred; US-04-AC-04: deferred.

Scope source: MVP-SC-01/MVP-SC-02, Gate 1 approved on 2026-11-06 by
“i approve gate 1 and authorize phase 2”. This scope revision does not claim
new implementation acceptance. Preserve the scope-decision comment and original
issue history.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **US-04-AC-01:** Agents resolve only explicitly delegated choices and record the proposed decisions and reasoning in the structured plan.
- [ ] **US-04-AC-02:** The plan identifies features, metric and direction, split protocol, allowed algorithms, and budgets.
- [ ] **US-04-AC-03:** Ambiguities and conflicts are surfaced before affected execution, and dependent work waits for approval through applicable gates.
- [ ] **US-04-AC-04:** Original inputs, resolved decisions, and their versions/checksums remain available in run lineage.

## Scope / Non-Goals

**In Scope:**

- Preserve the original criteria as deferred scope; no MVP implementation is authorized.

**Out of Scope:**

- Managed agents and autonomous loops; mandatory experiment workflow approvals.
- OS-enforced filesystem/network/credential/holdout isolation and arbitrary-Python bypass prevention.
- Hard runtime/resource/cost quotas, durable workflow recovery and comprehensive dirty-source replay.
- Additional frameworks and connectors beyond the approved MVP. Displaced clauses remain in the migration record.

## Implementation Phase

**Phase:** Not specified. Define story/milestone implementation phases and granular tasks in a separate owning plan.

**Deliverables:** Deferred requirement record only; no current product delivery.

**Developer Validation:** Confirm public test boundaries before executable tests. Stop at every implementation phase gate, including the final gate, for explicit developer approval.

**Exit Criteria:** A later explicit scope decision is required before implementation.

## Validation Approach

### Automated Validation

- Future checks must be planned when this roadmap scope is activated; deferral is not evidence of acceptance.

### Developer Validation

- Review criterion-mapped evidence, failures, artifact/run/data references and platform/tool identities.
- Preserve development approval gates and separate milestone verification obligations; do not infer runtime behavior from documentation.
