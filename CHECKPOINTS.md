# Development Checkpoints

Last updated: 2026-11-14 (UTC)

## Current position and next action

Checkout: `US-13-dataset-versioning`, HEAD `557414c` (approved IP3 committed).
Developer “start ip3”, 2026-11-14, authorizes IP3 only after approved Gates 1–2.
The issue body/all comment pages and final metadata were refreshed: one unique
comment matches count 1 and stable 2026-11-07T00:28:44Z update; no scope conflict.
M1 covers AC-01/02; AC-03/04 restoration remains M2.

IP3-T1/T2 complete: the existing assessment/splits driver runs guide-derived
CSV/Parquet recipes in direct/rebuilt normal wheel environments outside the
checkout; focused test 1 passed. A/B commits, native identities, cache/remote
retention, Git ownership and failure boundaries verified. Guide links and active
traceability updated. No product API/dependency/resource change. See the
[owning plan](docs/plans/milestone-1-us-13.md) and
[IP3 evidence](docs/verification/us-13-ip3.md).

IP3-T3 complete: M1 722 passed, 1 existing skip, 4 native NumPy warnings
(233.24s); final M1–6 722 passed, 1 existing skip, 4 warnings (222.86s).
Each selected 723 cases; unchanged 991-case inventory leaves 268 excluded.
Locked sync/lock, lint, formatting, strict typing, CLI smoke, relative links and
whitespace pass; lock hash unchanged. Raw records linked from IP3 evidence.

Developer “i approve ip3; commit”, 2026-11-14, approved Gate 3 and authorized
the local IP3 commit. Gates 1–3 are Approved. This commit contains IP3 probe/test
extensions, guide/links/design, plan, evidence, status and checkpoint.

Developer “i accept the us-13”, followed by “commit”, 2026-11-14, accepted
the delivered M1 slice (AC-01/02) and authorized a local acceptance-record commit.
All three gates are Approved. This acceptance changes no executable behavior;
IP3 verification remains applicable. Relative links and whitespace rechecked.

**Next action:** await publication or further development direction. US-13 M1 is
accepted locally, not yet merged; issue #16 remains open for M2 AC-03/04.
No milestone acceptance or push/publication is claimed. Linux aarch64 only;
macOS/Windows unverified.

US-41 publication and branch cleanup remain complete: issue #64 closed,
PR #65 squash-merged as `5d5781c`; Gates 1–4 Approved. Prior CI/evidence details
remain in its owning plan and reports. US-13 M1 is accepted locally; US-12 remains the latest merged M1
component. Historical M1/M50 and revised MVP milestone acceptance obligations
below remain open; drafting US-13 does not satisfy them.

## Completed work: authoritative records

Contributor skill added: `.agents/skills/report-test-progress/` monitors an
existing pytest session in the current chat and reports remaining/total,
completed and failed counts approximately every minute. It never launches tests;
unavailable counts remain explicitly unknown. Documentation-only instructions
and UI metadata add no executable behavior, so TDD does not apply. No pytest run
was started for this work. Existing US-12 changes and Gate 2 status are unchanged.

| Work | Final status and records |
|---|---|
| US-01–03 | Accepted and merged; [US-01](docs/plans/milestone-1-us-01.md), [US-02](docs/plans/milestone-1-us-02.md), [US-03](docs/plans/milestone-1-us-03.md). |
| US-11 | Accepted and merged in PR #60; [plan](docs/plans/milestone-1-us-11.md), [IP3 evidence](docs/verification/us-11-ip3.md). |
| US-12 #19 | Accepted and squash-merged in PR #62 as `980c97f`; [plan](docs/plans/milestone-1-us-12-assessment-splits.md), [IP4 evidence](docs/verification/us-12-19-ip4.md). AC-04 deferred. |
| US-12 #15 | Accepted and merged in PR #61; [plan](docs/plans/milestone-1-us-12.md), [IP3 evidence](docs/verification/us-12-ip3.md), correction linked above. |
| MVP scope revision | Accepted and published; PR #57 merged; US-39 #58 and US-40 #59 created. [Plan](docs/plans/mvp-scope-revision.md), [publication evidence](docs/verification/mvp-scope-revision-ip4.md). This accepts scope documents, not an implemented MVP. |
| US-41 | All six criteria accepted; issue #64 closed; PR #65 squash-merged as `5d5781c`. [Plan](docs/plans/milestone-50-us-41.md), [IP4 evidence](docs/verification/us-41-ip4.md). Historical M50 verification remains open. |
| US-35/36 | Accepted and merged in PRs #48/#50; [US-35](docs/plans/milestone-50-us-35.md), [US-36](docs/plans/milestone-50-us-36.md). US-37/38 remain local stories without implementation authorization. |
| Contributor tooling | Development guide reorganization, scheduling, dependency inventory and container work are recorded in [verification reports](docs/verification/) and Git history; container limitations remain below. |

Plans and reports own granular tasks, approvals, commands, failures and publication
records. Earlier checkpoint snapshots remain in Git history; superseded gate and
resume instructions have been removed. Historical records are not current authority
to proceed past a gate.

## Outstanding verification and known limitations

- **M1-ACCEPT-VERIFY — Milestone 1 acceptance verification:** Open. The
  [approved ownership record](docs/plans/milestone-1-us-03.md#scope-change-record-local-verification-policy-2026-10-31)
  owns the full local suite, reserved milestone test, unchanged caller and
  initialization regressions, upgrade/scheduling and remaining artifact checks.
  The historical US-03 snapshot deferred 132 of 315 collected cases. The
  [interrupted additional run](docs/verification/us-03-ip4.md#additional-full-suite-run-requested-after-phase-approval)
  is incomplete evidence, not a passing full run. Hosted CI success does not
  close this obligation.
- **M50-ACCEPT-VERIFY — Milestone 50 acceptance verification:** Not started.
  The [US-35 handoff](docs/plans/milestone-50-us-35.md#milestone-acceptance-handoff)
  and [US-36 plan](docs/plans/milestone-50-us-36.md) own full-suite, unchanged
  caller, reserved milestone and applicable platform/manual deferrals. The
  historical US-36 snapshot deferred 289 of 393 collected cases. This obligation
  remains independent of M1-ACCEPT-VERIFY.
- **Milestone evidence reconciliation:** Before milestone acceptance, reconcile
  all deferrals, selections and actual counts against final milestone inputs;
  run the full suite, shared checks and applicable distribution, installation,
  manual and platform checks under the
  [verification policy](docs/development/verification.md#phase-and-story-verification).
  Historical counts are not current test inventories. Story acceptance does
  not imply milestone acceptance.
- **US-36 evidence qualification:** The final direct run had 103 passes and
  one failure; the unchanged failing case passed on renewal after isolating
  verification resources. All 104 selected cases have passing evidence across
  those runs; no single all-passing 104-case run is claimed. Preserve the
  deprecated public pytest `Config.inicfg` compatibility-mapping limitation
  and overlapping-workload timing limitation documented in the
  [IP1 report](docs/verification/us-36-ip1.md) and
  [IP2 report](docs/verification/us-36-ip2.md).
- **Development container:** Build, startup and container development checks
  require report-specific evidence. A direct lifecycle-runner invocation succeeded,
  but automatic VS Code creation handoff remains unresolved. PR #51 records the
  generated pytest workspace-member concern. Hosted CI does not establish
  container functionality.
- **Platform coverage:** Coverage varies by report: earlier local evidence includes
  macOS arm64; recent US-11/12 evidence is Linux aarch64 / Python 3.12.16.
  Windows remains unverified. Consult each report for tested inputs and limits.
- **Test runtime:** Retain nested-pytest isolation and default installer
  concurrency. Hardlink optimization was rolled back. The
  [concurrency report](docs/verification/pytest-installer-concurrency.md)
  preserves performance attempts 1 and 2; no third corrective attempt was applied.

## Evidence preservation

Preserve historical baselines, failure logs, retained diagnostic workspaces,
input identities and verification records referenced by the owning reports.
Do not delete them as part of checkpoint cleanup. US-35 requires raw evidence
under `.dev-records/verification/` to be retained for the lifetime of agentic-ml
development; follow the [records guide](docs/development/records.md) for layout,
backup responsibility and cleanup protection.

Raw evidence paths and detailed measurements belong in verification reports.
Their storage availability has not been revalidated by this cleanup; check it
before reuse. Preserve failed verification evidence and attempt counts. Do not
substitute historical story checks for current or milestone verification.

## Maintenance rules

- Keep one current position and next action. Replace superseded resume instructions;
  use Git history and linked plans/reports for historical detail.
- Issues govern scope; plans own tasks, decisions, approvals and evidence. Resolve
  discrepancies against those sources before resuming. Link verification policy
  rather than duplicating it.
- At completed work, gates, blockers and handoff, refresh the date, checkout,
  working-tree changes, pending decisions, verification limits and deferred owners.
- Record approvals only after explicit developer decisions in the owning plan.
  Preserve failure evidence and attempt counts in linked records.
- Commit checkpoint updates alongside their work when authorized. Keep credentials
  and sensitive environment details outside this file.
